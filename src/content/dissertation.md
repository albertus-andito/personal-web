For my undergraduate degree dissertation (also called Final Year Project or FYP), I will undertake a project that I proposed, 
which is "Real-Time Ground Truth Update For Fake News Early Detection" (interim title).

A short description of this project is as follows:

> News are often about recent events, including events that are still happening. Thus, some knowledge and facts could become 
invalid in just a short period of time. A fake news detection system should be able to cope with such timeliness of news.

> As discussed, this project involves creating a prototype of a fake news early detection system, which automatically keeps 
the knowledge graph (where the ground truth is stored) updated in real-time. One way to do it is to scrape several trusted 
news sites every period of time. Then, for every news, the system extracts the SPO (Subject, Predicate, Object) triples 
from the facts, and puts them into the (dynamic) knowledge graph. Maybe some facts are already out of date, then the system 
should remove them. The main point of this system is to keep the Knowledge Graph updated automatically.

> Another component of this project is a web application that serves as the interface for the user to check whether a certain 
statement is correct or not, by querying the knowledge graph. The interface could also have a mechanism that allows the 
user to check whether the ground truth should be updated when the facts are believed to be out-of-date.

> The scope of this project should be limited to make it more feasible, such as by limiting the number of predicates or 
entity types, or maybe limiting the domain.

This page will be updated with the progress of the project.

Anyone that has interest in this topic or has any suggestion, feel free to contact me.
