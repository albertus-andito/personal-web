I am currently looking for a funded PhD project in fields related to Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning for 
September 2021, ideally in the UK.

I am also looking for graduate roles. My past experience made me more inclined towards Software Engineering roles, however I am 
open for other roles related to tech.
