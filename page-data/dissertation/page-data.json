Thus, some knowledge and facts could become\ninvalid in just a short period of time. A fake news detection system should be able to cope with such timeliness of news.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>This project involves creating a prototype of a fake news early detection system, which automatically keeps\nthe knowledge graph (where the ground truth is stored) updated in real-time. One way to do it is to scrape several trusted\nnews sites every period of time. Then, for every news, the system extracts the SPO (Subject, Predicate, Object) triples\nfrom the facts, and puts them into the (dynamic) knowledge graph. Maybe some facts are already out of date, then the system\nshould remove them. The main point of this system is to keep the Knowledge Graph updated automatically.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Another component of this project is a web application that serves as the interface for the user to check whether a certain\nstatement is correct or not, by querying the knowledge graph. The interface could also have a mechanism that allows the\nuser to check whether the ground truth should be updated when the facts are believed to be out-of-date.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The scope of this project should be limited to make it more feasible, such as by limiting the number of predicates or\nentity types, or maybe limiting the domain.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This page will be updated with the progress of the project.</p>\n<p>Anyone that has interest in this topic or has any suggestion, feel free to contact me.</p>","excerpt":"For my undergraduate degree dissertation (also called Final Year Project or FYP), I am undertaking a project that I proposed, \nwhich is \"Using Dynamic Knowledge…","frontmatter":{"date":null,"path":"/dissertation","title":"Dissertation"},"fields":{"readingTime":{"text":"2 min read"}}}},"pageContext":{}},"staticQueryHashes":[]}
